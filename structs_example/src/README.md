Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other and name each piece to make your code clear. In impl blocks, you can define the methods that are associated with your type.

You can implement all methods together in an impl block {} or use several. The latter should have a special reason.
