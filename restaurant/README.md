MODULES

Modules let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse. 
Modules also allow us to control the privacy of items, because code within a module is private by default. 
Private items are internal implementation details not available for outside use. 
We can choose to make modules and the items within them public, which exposes them to allow external code to use and depend on them.
