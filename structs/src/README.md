Using Structs to Structure Related Data

A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. A struct is like an objectâ€™s data attributes.

Define and instantiate structs and associated function / methods, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs and enum are the building blocks for creating new types.
