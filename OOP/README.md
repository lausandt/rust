Rust OOP

Rust does not implement a form of inheritance.

 - Structs
 - Enums
 - pub 
 - Traits:  Rust uses dynamic dispatch with traits, for the compiler doesn’t know all the types that might be used with the code that’s using trait objects, so it doesn’t know which method implemented on which type to call.
